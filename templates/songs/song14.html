[Intro]
F  Dm  Am  Am  2x
 
 
[Verse 1]
F                           Dm
 I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard 
Am
 I wish I had a better voice and sang some better words
F                           Dm
 I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
Am
 I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
F                      Dm
 I was told when I get older all my fears would shrink
    Am
But now I'm insecure, and I care what people think
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
          F               Dm              Am
My name's Blurryface, and I care what you think
          F               Dm              Am
My name's Blurryface, and I care what you think
 
 
[Chorus]
F               Em            Am      Em
  Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
Am         G           C                E N.C.
  When our mommas sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
Am              G             C       E
  Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
Am         G           C                E  N.C.               F Dm
  When our mommas sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
Am                F  Dm  Am  Am
  We're stressed out
 
 
[Verse 2]
F                                Dm
  Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
Am
  How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from
F                              Dm
  I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it
       Am
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only ever sell one
F                       Dm
  It'd be to my brother cause we have the same nose
     Am
Same clothes, home grown, the stones thrown from the creek we used to roam
F                             Dm
  But it would remind of when nothing really mattered
       Am
Out of student loans and tree house homes, we all would take the latter
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
          F               Dm              Am
My name's Blurryface, and I care what you think
          F               Dm              Am
My name's Blurryface, and I care what you think
 
 
[Chorus]
F               Em            Am      Em
  Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
Am         G           C                E N.C.
  When our mommas sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
Am              G             C       E
  Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
Am         G           C                E N.C.
  When our mommas sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
 
 
[Bridge]
   Am                              G
We used to play pretend, give each other different names
         C                                 E
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
        Am                                   G
Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face saying 
 C                        E
"Wake up you need to make money"
   Am                              G
We used to play pretend, give each other different names
         C                                 E
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
        Am                                   G
Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face saying 
 C                        E
"Wake up you need to make money"
 
 
[Chorus]
F               Em            Am      Em
  Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
Am         G           C                E N.C.
  When our mommas sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
Am              G             C       E
  Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
Am         G           C                E N.C.
  When our mommas sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
 
 
[Outro]
   F                             Dm
We used to play pretend, used to play pretend, bunny
   Am
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
F                             Dm
Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, bunny
   Am
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
F                               Dm
Used to play pretend, give each other different names
         Am
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
        F                                    Dm
Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face saying 
 Am
"Wake up you need to make money", yeah
