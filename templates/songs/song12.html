[Intro]
Am   E7   G   D   F   C   Dm   E7   x2
 
[Verse]
Am                         E7
  On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
G                      D
  Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air
F                          C
  Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
Dm
   My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
E7
  I had to stop for the night
 
Am                               E7
  There she stood in the doorway; I heard the mission bell
G
  And I was thinking to myself
              D
This could be heaven or this could be hell
F                          C
  Then she lit up a candle, and she showed me the way
Dm
   There were voices down the corridor,
E7
  I thought I heard them say...
 
[Chorus]
F                          C
  Welcome to the Hotel California.
       E7                                         Am
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place), such a lovely face
F                               C
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
    Dm                                       E7
Any time of year (any time of year), you can find it here
 
[Verse]
Am                            E7
 Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends
G                                    D
 She got a lot of pretty pretty boys   she calls friends
F                                   C
  How they danced in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Dm                       E7
  Some dance to remember, some dance to forget
 
Am                           E7
  So I called up the captain; Please bring me my wine (he said)
G                                     D
 We haven't had that spirit here since 1969
F                                         C
  and still those voices are calling from far away
Dm
   Wake you up in the middle of the night
E7
  Just to hear them say...
 
[Chorus]
F                         C
 Welcome to the Hotel California.
       E7                                         Am
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place), such a lovely face
        F                             C
They're livin' it up at the Hotel California
       Dm                                               E7
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise), bring your alibis
 
[Verse]
Am                        E7
   Mirrors on the ceiling; the pink champagne on ice (and she said)
G                                D
  We are all just prisoners here, of our own device
F                              C
  and in the master's chambers, they gathered for the feast
Dm
 They stab it with their steely knives but they
E7
just can't kill the beast
 
Am                             E7
   Last thing I remember, I was running for the door
G                                       D
  I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
F                                   C
  "Relax" said the night man; we are programmed to receive
Dm
  You can check out any time you like
E7
 But you can never leave...
